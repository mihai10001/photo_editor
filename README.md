# photo_editor
Simple cross platform web photo editor    
Could be implemented ridiculously easy by importing a JavaScript library that already does that, but I chose to make the implementation myself by linking web requests ( buttons, sliders ) with the Python Pillow library   
And for the lovely fullstack capabilites I will use Flask which is IMO the best web server that exists on this planet <3
